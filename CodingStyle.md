# Coding Guidelines

The CORTX Manager is a backend application that is built on [Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). 

We've listed the coding style that is specific to any submissions made to the CORTX Manager Repository.

### File Names

- All small case letters in the file name
- Separator: “_” 
- **Example:** `some_file.py`

### Indentation

- Use 4 spaces per indentation level.
- Continuation lines should align wrapped elements either vertically using Python's implicit line joining inside parentheses, brackets, and braces, or using a hanging indent.
- Add 4 spaces - an extra level of indentation to distinguish arguments from the rest.
  
  ```python
  def long_function_name(
        var_one, var_two, var_three,
        var_four):
    print(var_one)
    ```

- Hanging indents should add a level.

  ```python
    foo = long_function_name(
    var_one, var_two,
    var_three, var_four)
  ```

- Line length restriction to be 100 characters.
- Break Characters before binary operators, after comma and Brackets
- Use ‘...’  by default for strings.

### Imports

- Imports should usually be on separate lines.
  
  **Incorrect method:** `import sys, os, time` 
  **Correct method:**
  
  ```python
  import sys
  import os
  import time
  ```

- Imports are always put at the top of the file, just after any module comments and docstrings, and before module globals and constants.
- Imports should be grouped in the following order:
  - Standard library imports.
  - Related third party imports.
  - Local application/library specific imports.
- You should put a blank line between each group of imports.

### Docstrings

- It is mandatory to have comments/docstrings attached to each and every function except for @property or equivalent. 
- Docstrings should be informative.
- Follow the following Format 

    ```python
    def complex(real=0.0:float, imag=0.0: float) -> str:
    
    """
    Text description of what function does

       :param real:Real Number  
       :param imag:  imaginary number 
       :return:  Returns Complex value 
     """
     
       if imag == 0.0 and real == 0.0:
       return complex_zero
    ```

### Typings

Follow [3.6 Typings in Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/) to define function and methods as it enables easy understanding of the data fetched in a function

```python
def greeting(name: str) -> str:
return 'Hello ' + name
```

### String Concatenation

[Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498/) supports `f` string hence using `f` strings format is preferred than adding two strings as they create an extra object. 

**Example: 1**

```python
import datetime
name = 'Fred'
age = 50
anniversary = datetime.date(1991, 10, 12)
```

**Example 2:**

```python
f'My name is {name}, my age next year is {age+1}, my anniversary is {anniversary:%A, %B %d, %Y}.'
```

**Example: 3**

```python
'My name is Fred, my age next year is 51, my anniversary is Saturday, October 12, 1991.'
```

**Example: 4**

```python
f'He said his name is {name!r}.'
```
